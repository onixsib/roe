# Simple rules
## Before chaose

### Requirements

* Custle level c22
* Footman level T8

If these levels have not been reached, it's time to hurry up.

### Prepare

Over the next three weeks, you need to buy 2-3 thousand stones every day from the alliance store and send legions to collect, thereby replenishing the amount of stone in the alliance. This will give you a total of about 50,000 stones before the chaos begins.

Dear R4, there is no need to build resource stations during chaos. They should be built in the interval between chaos and Edem.

Please save your honor points, they will be needed.

### Start

At the beginning of chaos, you can use honor points to the maximum and get points in specialties.

We spend our specialty points on the construction specialty to the right and get an increase in loyalty. This allows you to take higher tile levels and immediately start gaining level 5 tiles.

Having collected the maximum number of tiles and resources, we reset the specialty and use the specialty points for the construction specialty to the left. This makes it possible to quickly recycle resources and raise the levels of honor buildings.

### Play

Please repeat the above until the chaos ends.

20 days before the end you will take 16 tiles.

Don't forget about assault fortress and guardian fortress - pumping them up allows t7 to take out other people's reinforcements t8 from the tile. And hold the tile.

Best regards, Kot.
